  "description": "What do you do when your student council doesn't have enough members to fill all the positions? Well, take most of them on your own, of course!\n\nSeishirou Watari is a middle school student and has the roles of student council president / secretary / treasurer / general affairs officer, and he's accompanied by Ryouko Mizutani, his vice president. Together they, wellâ€¦ make do with whatever little they have. What do you want? It's only the two of them, okay!?",
